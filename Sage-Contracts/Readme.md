# SAGE
SAGE "Save the Lost Girl" is a web adventure game with a mission to save a girl who is missing/captured by enemy forces named "SAGE", this game is dedicated to the Fantom Hackathon Q2 2023 which combines Unity, Web3, Fantom Opera and other technologies.

## WHY?

### 1. Have an on-chain game audit trail of each user that is stored in a database collection and stored in IPFS.

### 2. Safely share selected data from digital documents because SAGE does not store personal data like other game platforms.

### 3. Our platform opens up web3 workflows with smart contract hooks and AI

### 4. Using a decentralized Fantom chain and public blockchain as well as technologies that can revolutionize performance in gaming platforms using web3.

### 5. Play to Earn: Each players will get the rewards(SageNFT) if they completed each levels and can swap with SageToken(Core token for SAGE)

## There are 2 main repos:

### 1. Contract Data: Uses Solidity to complete the entire Game Protocol.

### 2. Data Game Project: Using Web3, Unity and Fantom Chain for on-chain development in game development.
